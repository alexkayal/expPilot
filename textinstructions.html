<p> This experiment is divided into 4 similar sub tasks, which, overall, should take around 8 minutes to complete. In each sub-task, a scenario will be displayed, regarding a familiar family life situation. 

<p> It is assumed that the characters in the scenario are in possession of a mobile device with a location sharing app.
 
 With that app, one can check-in at certain locations, share that check-in with others, 

andd make agreements with other people. 
<p>Each scenario stops at a specific problem. You assume the role of one of the characters. Your task is to construct an agreement, attempting to solve that problem, using a menu just like the agreement menu of the app solution. 
<p>At the end of each scenario, 
  
  assuming the agreement has been accepted by the other side, 
  
  you are requested to rate how the agreement menu and its options
  contributed towards solving the problem in the scenario.
<p>Finally, after the end of the 4th scenario, you will be requested to answer a short questionnaire of 6 items.
<p>When you are ready, please click the start button. 
  By doing so, you agree to our terms and conditions, which you can view beforehand.
  Note that before the 4 scenarios are presented, you will be shown a example scenario to help you practice. This scenario will not count in the experiment.</body>
